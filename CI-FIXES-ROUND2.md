# CI Fixes Applied - Round 2

## Summary of Changes

### Windows ✅ Fixed
**Issue**: Chocolatey vulkan-sdk package was broken (trying to download non-existent version 1.2.182)
**Fix**: Removed chocolatey vulkan-sdk installation entirely, now relies only on manual installation

**Changes**:
```bash
# Removed this broken line:
choco install vulkan-sdk --ignore-checksums -y

# Now only installs ninja via chocolatey:
choco install ninja -y
# Note: Chocolatey Vulkan SDK package is broken, relying on manual installation
```

### macOS ✅ Improved
**Issue**: Vulkan library not found even though Homebrew installation succeeded
**Fix**: Added comprehensive Vulkan detection and symlink creation

**Changes**:
1. **Better Homebrew Integration**: Check if Homebrew vulkan-sdk cask installation worked first
2. **Smart Symlinks**: Create symlinks from Homebrew locations to expected paths
3. **Comprehensive Search**: Look in multiple locations for Vulkan libraries and headers
4. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added detailed logging to understand what's available

**New Logic**:
```bash
# Check Homebrew installation first
if [ -d "/opt/homebrew/share/vulkan" ] || [ -d "/usr/local/share/vulkan" ]; then
  echo "✅ Vulkan SDK already installed via Homebrew"
  # Create symlinks to make it work with our build system
  ln -sf /opt/homebrew/lib/libvulkan.dylib ~/.vulkan-sdk/lib/libvulkan.dylib
  ln -sf /opt/homebrew/include/vulkan ~/.vulkan-sdk/include/vulkan
fi
```

### Linux ✅ Unchanged
No changes to Linux as it was working correctly.

## Expected Results

### Windows
- Should skip chocolatey vulkan-sdk installation 
- Should proceed directly to manual Vulkan SDK download and installation
- Should work with any version found in C:\VulkanSDK

### macOS  
- Should detect and use Homebrew Vulkan SDK installation
- Should create proper symlinks for library and header detection
- Should provide detailed debugging output if still failing
- CMake should find both Vulkan headers and library

## Debug Information Added

For macOS, the workflow now shows:
- Contents of ~/.vulkan-sdk/lib  
- Contents of /opt/homebrew/lib (vulkan libraries)
- Contents of /usr/local/lib (vulkan libraries)
- Location of vulkan.h header files
- Clear indication of what was found vs not found

This will help diagnose any remaining issues quickly.

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to trigger new CI run
2. Monitor specifically:
   - **Windows**: Should skip chocolatey step and proceed to manual installation
   - **macOS**: Should show detailed Vulkan detection output and hopefully find libraries
3. If macOS still fails, the debug output will show exactly what's missing

The fixes are conservative and should not break the working Linux build.
